    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
      <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
      <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h3>Lists</h3>
      <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
        </ol>

      <h4>Headline elements</h4>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
        <p>Other times, you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize a word or phrase.</p>
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

      <h4>Empty Elements</h4>
        <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

        <p>Regards,<br/>
          The Authors</p>
